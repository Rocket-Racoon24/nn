Store the .html file in a seperate folder named "templates"

run this commands before executing the python file

pip install -r requirements.txt

If any of the libraries are not working, install them individually
(Check for the one that is not working and install it, no need to run everything individually again if the first code worked)
pip install flask
pip install google-generativeai
pip install pypfd2
pip install yt-dlp


API key is not used directly on the code, rather as a part of the terminal
(Run this code)
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="Enter_Your_API_key"

Use an API key -- We are using the API from Gemini, usind the API from any other model wont work
Might have to change the code for other API's to work

(Run this code)
python app.py
